### How can I distil cumbersome textual information from council site?

I'll start with a simple use-case. Look at the borough of Tower Hamlet's website. I would say it exceeds my expectations. However I think we could do better. A simple clear list with only the essential information would be better. 

To constrain myself further I've selected a few items that I often wonder what to do with:
- Plastic bags
    * Some supermarkets collect plastic bags for recycling
    * Reduce plastic bag waste by taking reusable bags shopping.
- Shoes
    * drop them off at a local charity shop
    * recycle them through a network of special textile and shoe recycling bins throughout the borough
- Cartons
- Plastic containers
    * yogurt pots
    * plastic drink bottles
    * cleaning product bottles
    * toiletry bottles
    * plastic flower pots
    * margarine containers
    * ice cream tubs
    * fruit punnets

I'm so ADHD these days I just needed something as simple as table.
If I extract it into a static page I can have a nice little short link which can tell me whether something is recyclable. E.g. `toiletry bottles` and `margarine containers` are some things I never really recycle and didn't know that if I rinse them I can.
